# DTR: Define the Relationship 
#### *(Karl Nielsen, John Watterson)*

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

#### What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Karl - pair programming learning concepts that maybe aren't fully grasped but having to physically type the code is helpful. 
John - Same
We are always working together at the same time.  Not creating code separately so we don't have gaps in knowledge/understanding.

---

#### How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Direct, immediately, honestly, positive & actionable. Personal and professional feedback appreciated.  

---   

#### How would you describe your work style?
Work as a team, making sure we understand the concepts and going slow if there's confusion.  Asking for help when needed.  

--- 

#### What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Karl - organization, detail oriented, slow and steady.  
John - design oriented, UI/UX

---

#### Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Conflicting communication styles and partners being unaware of their impact.    
Lack of Poms.  
Not following DTR.  Be respectful of designated & agreed upon work times.

---

#### How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
Everyone is on the same page before moving forward.  Everyone reviews code.  Everyone gets to be heard and group will deliberate as to proper course of action based on situation.

---

#### What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
No distractions work environment - Turing or conference room or otherwise private and focused environment.    
Clear communication in PRs and making comments to clarify code before it gets merged.    
Keep project related conversations documented digitally for reference.    

---

#### What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
School day work days til 630-7  
Outside school days stick to later in the day work blocks (after noon-6 or whatever chunk feels appropriate based on daily goals)  

---

#### What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Clear direct authentic honest actionable.  Feedback is sometimes hard to give if unsure how person will take it.   
Call it as we see it.  Focus on how things impact us individually without blaming or pointing fingers.  
--- 

#### What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Karl - Strong with prototype methods, JS is also more fluid in creating methods and plugging data into the DOM.
John - weaknesses - jQuery, SASS, API's.  

---

#### How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Struggle to a reasonable degree before getting tips.     

---

#### How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Karl - Learning to implement new concepts in a way that are understandable after the project is done.  
John - Learning goals achieved, generating a (sexy looking) MVP.

---

#### How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
Call them when we see them.    
Virtual high fives and positive feedback on PRs and code that's been submitted to merge to master.    
Identify wins that will also translate to future projects.   
We want to make sure everyone understands the content, has an understanding of the code, have a well thought out plan of attack and execute it step by step in order.  Resulting in a working app that has a few extra extentions would also be a win. 

--- 

#### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
We were pretty thorough with this in the questions above.  

---

#### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
Coming together to have 2 perspectives as to how we could approach a problem together.

---

#### What do you need to look out for, in terms of strengths/working styles coming into conflict?
Clearly and overly communicate to avoid conflicts before they happen is our approach.

---

#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
Weekdays - 6-7pm cutoff.  Friday nights done with Turing work after retro.  Saturday full work day with clear objectives/benchmarks we want to accomplish.  
Breaks: 40 minutes of work - 10 minute POMs

---

#### What is the one hour/day that each teammate has on their calendar for personal study/practice time?
Sunday is the Fun day.

---

#### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?): 
All the time.  Slack/Text/Screen Share.  During the scheduled times we are available.
