## Features

* Users can view a list of all recipes & how much they cost in the All Recipes menu.
* Users can add recipes to their favorite list (heart button) or recipes to cook (oven glove button).
* When a recipe is clicked the recipe will load with cost, tags and instructions.
* A user can search for ingredients they may have around the house, or for keywords like 'snack'.

## Challenges

* Working fully remote was a rhythm that took acclimating to.  Once we got into a work flow using Tuple, we were very productive and successful.  
* Balancing work with preparation for quarantine due to the caronavirus pandemic simultaneously occurring in the world (project dates 3/23/20-4/2/20) was an initial challenge I wanted to note here for future reference.
* Data flow at times was confusing in how we were accessing the data sets in our classes.  By persevering through the confusion we gained a better grasp on Class structure.

## Wins

* Writing dry, dynamic code with a clearer understanding of passing parameters into functions.
* Clean modern design website with cute and inviting UI/UX.
* Excellent teamwork displayed by both members.  Code was 90% written using driver/navigator using Tuple screen sharing application.  

## Built With
